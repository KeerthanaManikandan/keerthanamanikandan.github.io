I study the neurobiology of resting state networks using high-resolution imaging and electrophysiology tools. My work lies at the intersection of neuroscience, signal, and image processing and machine learning. After my PhD, I am passionate about translating my research skills into real-world impact. 

Outside the lab, I'm usually found curled up with a book, exploring new restaurants. You can find my current reads at [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/30457155-keerthana).
